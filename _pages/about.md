I am a third year Linguistics Ph.D. student at the [University of Chicago](https://linguistics.uchicago.edu). I am interested in analyzing morphosyntactic changes in Korean, Manchu-Tungusic, and Mongolic languages and documenting them through field methods.
Currently, I am working on the historical ordering of Korean morphemes in the predicate morphology from the generative point of view and the insubordination of Korean nominalized clauses from the comparative point of view with neighboring Manchu-Tungusic and Mongolic languages.

Before starting the Ph.D. program at the University of Chicago, I completed my B.A. in linguistics and anthropology and M.A. in linguistics at Seoul National University. I have worked on Uilta (Manchu-Tungusic), Manchu (Manchu-Tungusic), and the Southwestern Korean dialect (Jeollabuk-do), which is my native language. I also translated The Little Prince into the Southwestern dialect of Korean as part of an attempt to revitalize it.
