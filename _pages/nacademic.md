Here's some stuff that I love other than linguistics. 
* Animals
* Fountain pens
* Beautiful handwritings
* Coffees
* Alcoholic beverages
    * Wines (especially spicy South American wines made from the Carménère or the Malbec grape)
    * Beers (except beers brewed by the major Korean beer companies. N.B. if you add some Soju, I'm in!)
    * Korean rice wines (*Makgeolli*)
* Songs sung in languages that I like the sounds (e.g., Cantonese, French, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Mongolian, Swedish, Tuvan, etc.)
    * If you know some nice songs that aren't sung in English or Korean, please do let me know!
* Cooking
* Playing the guitar
